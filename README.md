# Retrieve data from the Boerse Frankfurt API

Wrapper functions for using the undocumented API of BÃ¶rse Frankfurt (Frankfurt Stock Exchange, FSE).
This is a collection of functions (will be a package) that help getting data for financial instruments from the FSE. Most functions that retrieve data start with get_ and either need an isin or an asset class in case of bulk retrievals.

If you encounter any problems please raise an issue and we'll look into it.

We're happy for your feedback.
